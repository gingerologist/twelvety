# XiP on SAM9x60EK

## Background

In hardware, **eXecute In Place**, or **XIP** for short,  means some non-volatile memory device can be memory-mapped into address space and the code stored on such a device can be executed directly, without the need to copy them into ram before execution, provided that the code are properly aligned.

In software, XIP means such a hardware feature can be utilized for some special purposes, saving RAM, reducing start-up time or wakeup latency, etc. If the feature is utilized by a bare metal program...



## XIP on SAM9x60-EK

There are three ways to start the journey, and here I will try them all.

The first one is to build second stage bootloader (at91bootstrap), third stage bootloader (u-boot), kernel (including dtb), and rootfs independently, except for rootfs, which is built by buildroot.

The second one is to build them all with official buildroot distribution from buildroot.org.

The third is to build them all with microchip customized distribution from mchp's github repo, with or without the external repo.



We starts from the first way.

## build and flash at91bootstrap (vanilla)

### Clone the repo. 

```
git clone git@github.com:linux4sam/at91bootstrap.git
```

There are several branches and tags, with gitk or qgit (QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland, but not well supported) we can see version 4 have been kicking around for quite a whille (it seems buildroot use 3.x version tarball, need verification)



### configs

all config files are stored in `configs` folder. There are several file we are interested with.

```
$ ls configs | grep ^sam9x60ek
sam9x60ek_bkptnone_defconfig
sam9x60ekdf_qspi_linux_image_dt_defconfig
sam9x60ekdf_qspi_uboot_defconfig
sam9x60eknf_linux_image_dt_defconfig
sam9x60eknf_uboot_defconfig
sam9x60eksd_linux_image_dt_defconfig
sam9x60eksd_uboot_defconfig
```



No idea what bkptnone stands for (maybe backport note?). Others are straightforward. df stands for data flash (qspi), nf for nand flash, and sd for sd/mmc card. at91bootstrap can load u-boot, or linux kernel image directly. We choose this step since if kernel is on flash, we have no need for u-boot, which is primarily used for loading kernel and dtb from difference storage devices.



### build

```
make mrproper
make sam9x60ekdf_qspi_linux_image_dt_defconfig
make CROSS_COMPILE=/data/buildroot/buildroot-2024.08-rc2/output/host/bin/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabi-
```

Here I used buildroot toolchain on my machine.

```



### flash

In sam-ba folder. I use sam-ba 3.7 here. sam-ba 3.8 won't start on Ubuntu 20.04 due to GLIBC version.

```
cp /data/microchip/project_1/at91bootstrap/build/binaries/at91bootstrap.bin .
```



with proper jumper settings: the leftmost and rightmost jumpers are closed, others open.

Press and hold the 4th button (DIS_BOOT), press then release the 3rd button (reset), and release the 4th button. The processor enters romboot mode. (print RomBOOT periodically on ttyACM0, the usb port close to barrel power jack).



Erase the whole flash then download the boot loader.

```
./sam-ba -p serial -b sam9x60-ek -a qspiflash -c erase
```

```
./sam-ba -p serial -b sam9x60-ek -a qspiflash -c writeboot:at91bootstrap.bin

connect to USB port with minicom

```
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
```



Press the reset button

```

Next Goal, build kernel and download into flash.



## Kernel (non-XIP)
